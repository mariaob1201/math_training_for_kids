# Book of Mathematical Education for K12

Repo with the open-access book link for mathematical education [Book](https://www.scribd.com/document/490450987/cuadernillo-Olimpiadas-Matematicas-Gto-pdf). 

I worked on the creation of this book after several years helping as math instructor for the ONMAPS (National Olympiad of Mathematics for Kids of primary and secondary), when I was an undergraduate student. I am proud to see that the book was distributed openly across the State of Guanajuato in 2019. 

Nothing of this would even be possible without the support of my friends and colleagues and the Government of Guanajuato for their generosity sponsoring the project to bring mathematics to multiple municipalities across the state with workshops.

Thank you especially to Ceci for being such a wonderful himan being.
Thank you Christian, Ale, Luis, Chus (Jesus) and Paty for being such awesome people I had the pleasure to work with.
