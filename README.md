# math_training_for_kids

Repo with the open-access book for mathematical education. I worked on the creation of this book after 4 years helping as math instructor for the ONMAPS National Olympiad of Mathematics for Kids of primary and secondary schools when I was an undergraduate student. 
The book was distributed openly trhough the state of Guanajuato in 2019. 

Nothing of this would even be possible without the support of my colleagues and friends, particularly from the mentorship and vision of Ceci, an admirable human being a friend that teach me to see always the best of people.
Thank you Ceci, Christian, Ale, Luis, Chus (Jesus) and Paty.
