# math_training_for_kids

Repo with the open-access book for mathematical education [Book](https://www.scribd.com/document/490450987/cuadernillo-Olimpiadas-Matematicas-Gto-pdf). 

I worked on the creation of this book after several years helping as math instructor for the ONMAPS National Olympiad of Mathematics for Kids of primary and secondary schools when I was an undergraduate student. I am proud to see that the book was distributed openly trhough the state of Guanajuato in 2019. 

Nothing of this would even be possible without the support of my colleagues and friends, particularly from the mentorship and vision of Ceci, an admirable human being a friend that teach me to see always the best of people and of course from the Government of Guanajuato for their generosity sponsoring the project to bring mathematics to multiple municipalities across the state with workshops.

Thank you Ceci, Christian, Ale, Luis, Chus (Jesus) and Paty for being such awesome people I had the pleasure to work with.
